        <h2>Management Team</h2>
        <p>
            The founders of Petrware are UCI's best and brightest ICS Software Engineering students. Derek Tran is the
        Chief Executive Officer of Petrware. He initially proposed the company's core e-commerce product foundation
        and began the company's overall path. Derek Tran brings much needed leadership and experience from years of
        grueling courses including Informatics 121 and Informatics 122.  Jevford Barro is Petrware's Chief Technology
        Officer. Jevford has extensive experience in full stack web development with an emphasis on the React
        framework. Peter Tang is the Chief Operating Officer who has a close connection with Linus from Linus Tech
        Tips.  His close relationship with Linus from his early days at NCIX up until his heartbreaking non-retirement
        announcement brings validation to Petrware's high-end product selection.
